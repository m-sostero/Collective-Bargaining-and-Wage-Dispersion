- Revision: first
---

## Major points
- (#background, @editor, @rev1) cite sociological theories of firm wage setting, eg:
    + Cobb (2016) “How Firms Shape Income Inequality” Acad. Manag. Rev.
    + Stainback et al. (2010) “Organizational approaches to inequality” Annu. Rev. Sociol.
- (#background, @rev1): cite extensively the “Varieties of Capitalism” literature, or or at least present a set of hypotheses that account for unique national institutions that may amplify or reduce the possible effects of FLB on inequality
- (#extend, @rev2) link results with theory
- (#expand, @editor, @rev1): examine interaction of *time* and *national institutions* (peeve).
- (#expand, @editor): Explore the role of national insitutions, especially but not restricted to collective bargaining institutions.
- (#contribution, @rev1): explain what is our contributions in the specific focus we place on the occupation-related content of wage differentials within firms; and what the results add to our preexisting understandings of FLB and within-firm inequality
- (#extend, @rev2) add wage dispersion of D9/D5, D5/D1

## Clarify-justify
- (@rev1) check: p. 16: “…larger firms display lower wage dispersion than the baseline in the UK.” 
- (#robustness, @editor, @rev1): compare results with country-specific impacts of including firms that do not have any collective bargaining on the samples
- (#robustness, @editor) “check robustness of heterogenous results to methodology” (?!)
- (#robustness, @rev1) compare results w/o firm fixed effects
- (@rev2) clarify “FLB vs MLB”
- (@rev2) explain hierarchy of collective agreements in data
- (@rev2) better summary stats on N firms by type of bargaining; “Table 1 should be used to better present the structure of the sample (as a weighted percentage of firms and not in terms of number of firms)”
- (@rev2) better summary stats of main variables

## Easy fixes
- (@rev1) clarify: p. 11: “…we define our working sample as including only firms with at least three employees.”  At least three employees sampled
- (@rev1) Table 1:  explain diff in the number of firms per country across year.
