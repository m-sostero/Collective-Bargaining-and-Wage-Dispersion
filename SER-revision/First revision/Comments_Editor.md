## Comments for the author

Dear Federico Tamagni,

Your manuscript SER-2018-0030 entitled "Firm-level pay agreements and within-firm wage inequalities: Evidence across Europe" has been reviewed.

We have decided not to print the paper in its present form. You may, however, resubmit it to SER after fundamental revisions along the lines of the reviews and my subsequent suggestions.

The reviewers find much to recommend this paper but at the same time all see the same core issues that need to be addressed:

1) What are the country specific impacts of excluding firms that do not have any collective bargaining on the samples?.
2) You mention, but do not explore, the role of national insitutions, especially but not restricted to collective bargaining institutions.
3) How robust are your heterogenous results to method?

In the end your pattern of results require you to think more seriously about the interaction of time and national institutions. Since SER has been particularly interested in these aspects of cross-national labor markets you should be as well. This is where you analyses point, suggesting SER is not only an appropriate place to publish the paper but also to look at past research on both the varieties of capitalism and firm level analyses of inequality.

Finally, my read of the paper is a bit less generous than the reviewers on one dimension. You use old thoiught experiement theories from economics that were developed to explain why workplace (as opposed to market) wage setting might be worth thinking about. The literature, at least in management and sociology, is far from this naive starting place at this point. Where is your engagement with theories of firm wage setting? You might look at the review articles in the Academy of Management Review (Cobb) and Annual Review of Sociology (Stainback et al) to get up to speed.
