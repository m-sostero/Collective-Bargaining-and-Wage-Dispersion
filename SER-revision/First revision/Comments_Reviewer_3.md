## Comments to the Author

The article investigates the effect of “single-employer” collective agreements on wage inequality within firms. This is a relevant topic for research on the increase on wage inequality in recent times because the impact of firms on this increase is still under-researched though firms are the central arena where wages are generated.

The empirical design of the study is very interesting as the study conducts an international comparison of such firm-effects. Such a comparison is important because we can expect that national bargaining regimes shape the effect of single-employer agreements on wages. On top of that, the authors use different measures for within-firm inequality, allowing for different mechanisms showing up which would address the wages of different types of workers in the firm.
The empirical part of the paper is very sophisticated. The analytical strategy is appropriate, using a high-quality dataset whose survey design gives a rich set of information to investigate the intended research question. A broad bunch of controls at individual and firm level, as well as the control for propensity scores creates much confidence in the validity of the results.

However, to speak frankly, I am a bit disappointed from the theoretical part of the paper. We do not learn much about why firm-level agreements would affect the inequality within firms. In the introduction, the authors list a bit  superficially various well known theories of wage determination, only loosely ordered as identifying “direct” and “indirect” mechanisms which connect firm-level bargaining to wage inequality. Unfortunately, these mechanisms may enhance within-firm inequality or diminish it, so we do not have any indication of what would happen in the analyses.

A similar objection concerns the second section of the paper. Here, the authors describe the collective bargaining regimes in the countries under study. The idea behind this presentation seems to be that the different types of bargaining regimes shape the meaning, hence the impact, of firm-level bargaining for the wage setting process. However, we do not learn much about the question which type of bargaining regime would lead to an inequality-increasing effect of firm-level agreements, and which type would lead to an inequality-reducing effect (with one notable exception: In Spain, firm-level bargaining seems to be driven by unions, so it would result in an inequality-reducing effect. But the results for the 90-10 gap indicate the other direction, while firm level bargaining compresses only the occupational wage gap).

Thus, the paper remains mainly descriptive. This becomes obvious in the results part of the paper, which verbalises the coefficients of the the tables, only very loosely building connections to the theoretical part of the paper. So we learn (in the “conclusions” section) that firm level bargaining matters (somehow), that its impact on wages is different between countries (but we see no pattern in the differences), that the effects change over time (we get even fewer clues why this is the case) and that different types of workers are affected differently.

To be sure: these conclusions make a significant contribution to the literature about collective bargaining and its impacts on wage inequality. So I would agree to the publication of the article as it is. However, I am convinced that the paper would gain from a more refined theoretical framework, possibly drawing some more precise hypotheses, declaring under which bargain regimes which types of workers are affected by firm level bargaining, resulting in increasing or decreasing within firm inequality.
