## Comments to the Author

This paper deals with an interesting and topical subject because national collective bargaining systems have been the subject of reforms, of varying scope depending on the country, in recent years. In particular, these reforms were initiated following the 2007-2008 economic and financial crisis and the implementation of the new European economic governance pushing governments to strengthen the process of decentralisation of collective bargaining.

The article is well written, clear and interesting but clarifications deserve to be made in the revised version of the article. My main suggestions are related to the database and the way the authors are working with it.

1) As it is announced in the introduction, the objective of the paper is to assess the effects of the decentralizstion of collective bargaining on pay inequalities. It seems to me that this wording should be revised. In fact, the authors estimate the impact of the existence of collective bargaining at firm level (and not decentralisation) on wage inequalities. More specifically, it seems to me that the paper issue should be: does bargaining at the firm level (rather than at another level) have an effect on wage inequality?
The process of decentralization has been initiated for more than three decades in Europe and it would be necessary to observe the firms practices over a longer period to claim to evaluate the effects of decentralization. Admittedly, the authors mention this nuance on p. 8, but this should be said in the introduction.

2) Concerning the data, it would be interesting to give more information on the variables used.

Given the complexity of national collective bargaining systems and that several levels of collective bargaining can coexist, the reader would like to know:
- the share of firms covered by collective bargaining at firm level only,
- The share of firms covered by company collective bargaining at firm and collective bargaining at a higher level (industry or inter-professional)
- The share of firms  covered by a higher level agreement (and not by company collective bargaining)
- And finally those with no agreement (whatever the level of bargaining).

More specifically, Table 1 should be used to better present the structure of the sample (as a weighted percentage of firms and not in terms of number of firms). Moreover, the authors write that their working sample only concerns firms covered by a firm level agreement (whatever the level): we would like to know how the fact of excluding firms that are not covered by collective bargaining may change the size and the structure of the sample.  Similarly, not distinguishing between companies covered by a firm level agreement only from those combining different forms of collective bargaining seems to be a problem. Indeed, in France for instance, the same firm can be covered by an industry agreement and a firm-level agreement: how is this fact taken into account in the econometric estimation? Does that bias the results?

3) Similarly, as it is usual in the literature, it would be useful to provide descriptive statistics on the main explanatory variables (characteristics of enterprises, employees, etc.) in an appendix.

4) With regard to dependent variables, the authors use two indicators: the inter-decile ratio (D9/D1) and the pay gap between managers and the low-layers employees. Such analysis could be specified by two other indicators that reflect inequalities at the top (D9/D5) and bottom (D5/D1) of the wage hierarchy: looking at these indicators would show to what extent the different wage levels are impacted by collective bargaining. Since managers' compensation is often determined outside collective bargaining (and this is particularly the case in France), it would be useful to study the two latter indicators. As with the other variables, it would be useful to provide descriptive statistics on the dependent variables and comment briefly on them in the text.

3) The interpretation of the results could be specified by making a more explicit link with the theoretical hypotheses that are discussed in the introduction. Moreover, the link between the institutional specificities of national collective bargaining systems is not explained. More particularly, what kind of collective bargaining system is associated with more or less inequality?

4) The authors present only one econometric method: have the results been confirmed by an alternative method? It would be interesting to use a double-difference matching method, which might be appropriate given that the authors work with a panel data.

5) p.8, the presentation of the French system should be rewriitten. Indeed, the authors mention the introduction of the inversion of the norms hierarchy in 2004. However, this only concerns working time. And in practice, few firms make use of the derogation. In 2017, a reform extended the inversion of the hierarchy of standards to numerous topics, but it is still too early to measure its effects.

Finally, it should be noted that wage bargaining in France are mandatory for any firm with 50 or more employees. This can make it difficult to estimate the specific effect of collective bargaining at firm level since it is not possible to know what would happen in their absence.
