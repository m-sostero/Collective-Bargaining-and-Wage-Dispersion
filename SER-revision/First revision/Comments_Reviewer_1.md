## Comments to the Author

Using data from six European nations and two time periods, the author analyses whether firm-level bargaining is associated with higher or lower within-firm inequality.  Unlike prior treatments, the author models different types of inequality.  One set of analyses models 90/10 ratios, commonly used in related research.  The other set departs from previous investigations by modeling occupational pay dispersion, operationalized as the wage spread between average managerial pay and the average pay of lower-level employees within firms.  Various hypotheses are proposed, some suggesting that devolving bargaining to the firm-level should narrow intra-firm inequality; others suggesting the opposite.  Results indicate that the effect of firm-level bargaining (FLB hereafter) is specific to each country’s particular set of relevant institutions.  Not only do the effects of FLB vary between countries, they also seem to vary within countries depending on the year of analysis and the inequality measure.  

This is an interesting piece with an intriguing set of results.  But I think it could stand a much fuller theoretical treatment to prepare readers better for the pretty pattern-less findings. 

I elaborate on this and other issues below. 
1) There seems to be a pretty substantial amount of literature done on this topic, with the author conceding on p.4 that the “major departure pertains to the specific focus we place on the occupation-related content of wage differentials within firms.”  If that’s the case, then we need to hear more about why this departure is so important, and what the results add to our preexisting understandings of FLB and within-firm inequality. 
2) The analyses seem perfectly competent.  That the results are really all over the place, and don’t really coalesce around any patterns, isn’t a disqualification, of course.  But the article could really use a robust engagement with the varieties of capitalism literature, or at least present a set of hypotheses that account for unique national institutions that may amplify or reduce the possible effects of FLB on inequality.  As it stands, what we get is an outline of competing expectations from the labor economics literature divorced from specific institutional contexts, and then a nod to national characteristics that may have some impact on FLB and inequality.  But the discussions aren’t integrated in any way. 
3) Similarly the time differences are undertheorized.  Early on, the author mentions the inclusion of 2010 as a way to test the (possible) effects of the financial crisis.  But when describing the results, this early emphasis largely disappears.  What, theoretically, does the author expect to differ between the two years?  How should the relationships between FLB and inequality change?  And why? 
4) On p. 11 the author states that the sample is limited to only firms with at least some form of collective bargaining.  Why?  That seems like a significant sampling decision.  What motivates it?  What does it mean for, say, Great Britain, where collective bargaining is comparatively rare?  Doesn’t this mean we are comparing a select group of firms in Great Britain to a much more representative set of firms in a country like Belgium where collective bargaining is much more common?   
5) In Table 1 there are dramatic differences in the number of firms per country across year.  Why? 
Smaller issues 
6) p. 11: “…we define our working sample as including only firms with at least three employees.”  At least three employees sampled, right? 
7) What do the results look like without the firm fixed effects? 
8) p. 16: “…larger firms display lower wage dispersion than the baseline in the UK.”  This is an odd finding, no?  May it have to do with the unique set of UK firms in the author’s data?
