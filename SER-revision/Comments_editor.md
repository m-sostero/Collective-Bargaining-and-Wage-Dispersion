## Comments for the author

Dear Federico Tamagni,


Your manuscript SER-2018-0030.R1 entitled "Firm-level pay agreements and within-firm wage inequalities: Evidence across Europe" has been reviewed.

We have decided not to print the paper in its present form. You may, however, resubmit it to SER after fundamental revisions along the lines of the reviews and my subsequent suggestions.

The reviewers are in agreement that this paper might be accepted for publication at this time. I am not in agreement and so I am asking for a further revision. I will act as the reviewer if you decide to resubmit, which I hope that you do.
My most serious concern is the sharp drop in sample size associated with your two version of the dependent variable. In all countries the sample size for the ratio of the top 2 to the bottom 2 occupation codes is much reduced. Presumably this is because many workplaces do not have any occupations in the top (probably few) and the bottom (probably many) occupations. Thus you are comparing two very different samples in your analyses. I am a big fan of the occupation approach you have introduced here (and I see in an earlier paper in Industry and Innovation), but you are also comparing apples to oranges in your analyses. Thus some of the heterogeneity in your results is likely to be sectoral. Most of the economy is dropped from your occupational analyses. I can see two solutions to this problem, you may see others. You can define the occupational measure as top to bottom occupations, and define the bottom as lowest ranked occupations observable or, perhaps, change the measure to prof/manger vs all others. Another, less satisfying solution, would be to do the 90/10 analysis for the same truncated sample you use for the occupational analyses and see which sample results get replicated. In any case, this problem represents for me a fatal, but fixable flaw, in the current paper.
Second, both reviewers hoped for more closure on the temporal and country comparisons than you provide. I do not, my sense is you are recognizing real variability and the limits of the economic theory you start with. I also think that you do a good job pointing out the potential complexity of institutional effects and that your results do not conform to a simple variety of capitalism model. The more organizational papers you now cite (Cobb and Stainback et al.) are, however, much more open to complex variation because both conceptualize institutional influences as multiplex. Thus you do have the theoretical tools to predict or at lease explain variability. More substantively I am left wondering about the role of what you call "Opening clauses" First, this needs to be explained more completely. I am also wondering if the content of of these clauses varies across countries and potentially explains country variations? Right now you are assuming that firm level bargaining happens or is permitted for the same institutional reasons across countries. Are they? For example, if the clause states that firm level bargaining is permissible to meet global competition demands – it would tend to decrease inequality as it decreased wages across the division of labor (e.g. Germany, especially before 2010). If the clause permitted firm negotiations to respond to local labor supply it might do the opposite, further strengthening the top end of the distribution, while lowering the claims making power of the less skilled.
Smaller issues:
You refer to the occupational comparison as Professional vs low level in the text and Manager vs low level in the tables. I think you are trying to get at what a sociologist or political scientist might call class here. I think you should get your language strait at a minimum. You could simply go with Professional-Managerial which has wide usage both inside and outside of class analysis.
Finally, I do not see any mention of weighting in the regressions. If this is the case than small organizations have equal weight to large ones in the estimation. My intuition is that this decision could be profoundly consequential for estimates. Can you justify the choice? Or are the estimates weighted by size and I missed where you noted this? Does it matter?

Comments to the Author
The revised version seems to respond convincly to the comments made on the first version. However, I still find that the results deserve to be interpreted more precisely. For example, we would like to know why the distribution of wages becomes more unequal in France and Spain between 2006 and 2010 (p. 19). What interpretation can be made of it ? As mentionned at the first reading, the interpretation of the results could be specified by making a more explicit link with the theoretical hypotheses that are discussed in the introduction. Moreover, the link between the institutional specificities of national collective bargaining systems is not explained. More particularly, what kind of collective bargaining system is associated with more or less inequality?

Finally, the theoretical developments proposed in the introduction are welcome, but it seems hat the introduction is too long (more than 4 pages). Wouldn't the paper become clearer if the authors proposed a section on literature review and a shorter introduction ?

Comments to the Author
I highly appreciate the authors’ efforts to improve the theoretical reasoning of the paper. There are two main parts of the argument. The first part reasons why FLB would increase or decrease firm-level wage inequality in general (section 1), the second part reasons why effects of FLB vary over countries (section 2). Overall, both parts have become clearer, and indeed, as proposed in the “replies to the referees”, the discussion section also has been improved, now evaluating the results in the light of the theoretical part of the paper. Since weaknesses in the theoretical reasoning have been my main point of concern, I now would recommend the paper for publication.
Nonetheless I would like to say that I still see some room for improvement, especially in the first part of the argument, where “theoretical reasoning” consist mainly in just sketchily mentioning some basic economic theories. However, I acknowledge the more explorative scope of the paper; moreover, the quite inconsistent results of the empirical part give little chances to test or to develop theories. The strength of the paper consists of its empirical contribution, posing more questions than giving answers, but this could provide a good starting point for further research in this area.
